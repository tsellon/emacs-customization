* Questions
** Git mode
*** TODO How to get the git.el path automatically, instead of setting it manually.
** Server mode
*** What's the best way to use it?
*** Should I start an emacs daemon on mac and remap emacs in bash to "emacsclient -c"?
    "emacs --daemon" to start the emacs server daemon
    "emacsclient -c" (or -t) to connect a client
    assign "emacsclient" to EDITOR in the environment
*** Any reason I'd ever want multiple server instances?
